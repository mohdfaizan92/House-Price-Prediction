# House-Price-Prediction

# ðŸ“Œ Overview:

This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning based on features like area, rooms, location, and more. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment with a web app.

# Features:

Data cleaning & EDA

ML models= LinearRegression(), DecisionTreeRegressor(),RandomForestRegressor().

But in this project the DecisionTreeRegressor(),perform better result.

# Libraries used in this project:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,matplotlib, and etc.
